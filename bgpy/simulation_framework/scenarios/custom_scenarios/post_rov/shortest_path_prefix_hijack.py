        # many different times, and you essentially are doing BFS 1000 times
        # due to the size of the provider + peer cone.
        # The only way to avoid rechecking the ASes, and avoid blowing up the RAM
        # is actually to use propagation ranks, since the graph is essentially ordered
        # As to why it seems to occur so frequently, when the input clique typically
        # should have non adopting ASNs, it's because about .2% of the CAIDA graph
        # gets disconnected. That means 99.8% of the time, a victim can reach the
        # input clique. But .998 ^ 1000 trials means ~13% chance that the victim
        # can reach the input clique every time. That's why we had to fix this,
        # even though in theory the problem should rarely occur.

        # So this is in the end doing something very similar to propagation
        # however, there are a few differences that I think make this worth keeping
        # 1. It's wayyyy faster than copying announcements and function call overhead
        #    especially with non-simple policies
        # 2. We can use this to modify any hijacks (whereas if this used propagation,
        #    it would be it's own scenario class
        # 3. The algo stops when it reaches a non adopting ASN, and the overwhelming
        #    majority of the time, that's going to be in the provider cone of the root
        #    asn, which is usually < 1000 ASes, which is going to be very fast

        """Performs Shortest path prefix hijack against BGPiSec classes

        For this attack, since bgp-isec transitive attributes are present,
        an actual announcement in a local RIB of an AS must be chosen
        (this assumes the attacker can see any local RIB through looking glass
        servers or route collectors, etc). This is unlike the theoretical shortest
        path like against ASPA (or in other words - when attacking ASPA you
        want the shortest plausible path. When attacking bgpisec you need the
        shortest path that exists).

        To do this, we iterate through all ASes and choose an announcement that
        has the shortest path in a local RIB where the last AS on the path is not
        adopting. Then the attacker appends their ASN and we repropagate.
        We could do this using algorithms and such depending on the class, but
        that can be a future improvement. For now I'm going for accuracy.

        A caveat for selecting the best shortest path - the attacker should always
        prefer announcements which have no OTC attributes over announcements with
        OTC attributes, since the attacker would then be detected less when
        propagating to providers.

        Additionally, much like an AccidentalRouteLeak, previously the attacker would
        simply modify their local RIB and then propagate again. However - this
        has some drawbacks. Then the attacker must deploy BGPFull
        (that uses withdrawals) and the entire graph has to propagate again.
        BGPFull (and subclasses of it) are MUCH slower than BGP due to all the extra
        computations for withdrawals, RIBsIn, RIBsOut, etc. Additionally,
        propagating a second round after the ASGraph is __already__ full
        is wayyy more expensive than propagating when the AS graph is empty.

        Instead, we now get the announcement that the attacker needs to leak
        after the first round of propagating the valid prefix.
        Then we clear the graph, seed those announcements, and propagate again
        This way, we avoid needing BGPFull (since the graph has been cleared,
        there is no need for withdrawals), and we avoid propagating a second
        time after the graph is alrady full.

        Since this simulator treats each propagation round as if it all happens
        at once, this is possible.
