        Changes the valid prefix to be received from a customer
        so that in the second propagation round, the AS will export to all
        relationships

        NOTE: the old way of doing this was to simply alter the attackers
        local RIB and then propagate again. However - this has some drawbacks
        Then the attacker must deploy BGPFull (that uses withdrawals) and
        the entire graph has to propagate again. BGPFull (and subclasses
        of it) are MUCH slower than BGP due to all the extra
        computations for withdrawals, RIBsIn, RIBsOut, etc. Additionally,
        propagating a second round after the ASGraph is __already__ full
        is wayyy more expensive than propagating when the AS graph is empty.

        Instead, we now get the announcement that the attacker needs to leak
        after the first round of propagating the valid prefix.
        Then we clear the graph, seed those announcements, and propagate again
        This way, we avoid needing BGPFull (since the graph has been cleared,
        there is no need for withdrawals), and we avoid propagating a second
        time after the graph is alrady full.

        Since this simulator treats each propagation round as if it all happens
        at once, this is possible.

        Additionally, you could also do the optimization in the first propagation
        round to only propagate from ASes that can reach the attacker. But we'll
        forgo this for now for simplicity.
