        """Regarding the compare_graph_data kwarg:

        There was quite a debate on whether or not the engine tester
        should compare metrics. There are a lot of cons for comparing
        metrics here. Every single time the metrics change, all of the
        test data needs to be overwritten. This means even if you add
        a new metric, the test data needs to be overwritten, even if it
        is unrelated to the metrics, and you'll need to double check the
        ground truth of everything once again. metrics are also very
        finnicky, if JSON or CSV layouts change, they are prone to breakage
        without actually being a true failure. If the layout changes then
        those files change in git, even though no code has been modified.
        On top of that, different
        simulation_frameworks for different projects have different
        metrick trackers, some of which are quite different, some of which
        have no metrics at all. It also breaks
        the single responsibility of these being engine tests, to test the
        engine, not the simulation_framework. metric tracker could also be
        tested with unit tests.

        As for the cons, some tests would require a full round of propagation
        for a true metric tracker test. While the majority of the feedback
        was to remove it, one project was already using it. In light of that,
        being able to compare metrics in this test class will remain a feature,
        but by default it will be off. I've left an example to show how
        other projects could implement their own versions of it.
